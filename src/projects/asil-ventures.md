Lisa Green's business development firm, ASIL Ventures, needed a new website. As someone who helps connect businesses and nonprofits with government and private-sector grants, Lisa needed her website to convey a large amount of fairly niche information, *and* do so in an appealing and memorable way. 

I worked with Lisa to focus in on a brand voice, and from there I built a visual identity. She wanted to keep her existing logo, so I used the golden yellow as an anchor to tell a story about Lisa's organization, professionalism, and expertise. Then, I built that concept into a fully responsive WordPress website.

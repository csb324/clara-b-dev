Is it an art project? Is it a fun new tech challenge for me? Is it a design tool for everyone? It's all of the above!

I built this after noticing these noisy gradient textures are everywhere right now, but they're sort of a pain to generate. Can't we get computers to do it for us? 

It turns out, yes. Yes we can.

When Sophie Smith Quinn, the amazing jewelry designer behind <a target="_blank" href="https://couplet.org">Couplet</a>, asked me how she could price and sell her custom pieces on Shopify, we put together a solution. 

Sophie has a gift for making totally custom works of art - whether she's desiging around a vision you had, or a stone that once belonged to a family member. But the pricing on these pieces are as unique as the pieces themselves, and she was struggling to list her custom offerings within the framework of her Shopify theme.

Our solution was to create a custom-coded "Contact Us" feature, pulling in the standard Shopify contact form on every custom product page. Behind the scenes, the form also sends Sophie information about which page the customer was on when they submitted their inquiry, so she has a better understanding of what they might be looking for.

Craftdood is a personal project I created for an art supply shop and community makerspace. I wanted to see if I could help a design move beyond Comic Sans, without losing brand equity. I incorporated playful shapes, bright colors, and a DIY aesthetic to help Craftdood move forward, without losing what makes their business unique.

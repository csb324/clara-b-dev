A single purpose art-code hybrid piece. The Infinite Cities project draws one city block at a time. It's probably making a grand statement about zoning regulations, but I couldn't possibly be asked to comment on that. Mostly, like most of my generative art pieces, [it's an experiment that I hope you enjoy](https://infinite-cities-2.glitch.me/).
